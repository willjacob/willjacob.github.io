        <h2>About Me</h2>
        Prior to Kellogg, Will was a Consultant with Deloitte Consulting’s Strategy & Operations practice. His engagements focused in Mergers & Acquisitions and Strategy, primarily for Health Care & Life Sciences and Consumer Products clients.
        <p>
        Will has worked in all phases of the M&A lifecycle, including pre-announcement due diligence, financial modeling and synergy analyses, Day 1 readiness, post-integration support, and divestiture planning. Will has experience leading senior-level executive interviews, conducting synergy analyses, modeling back-office stand-up and integration costs, developing business cases, facilitating workshops, completing functional integration planning, and writing corporate communications. 
        <p>
        His transformational projects include an academic medical center acquisition that transformed it into one of the nation’s largest hospitals and Day 1 planning for a generics pharmaceutical merger that doubled the company’s size. Other highlights include developing a strategic business case for two large health plans considering a combination, conducting a strategic finance transformation assessment for an academic medical center, and supporting a revenue cycle transformation for a large community hospital network.
        <p>
        Beyond client service, Will is actively involved in the Boston community. Will was Co-President of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's Young Leadership Committee in Boston, working towards a cure for Type 1 Diabetes through targeted fundraising efforts and events in Boston.
